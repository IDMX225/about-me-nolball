            <div>
                <p>My name is Nolan Duarte. I am a first-year student at RVCC. I am the youngest of three and I have two brothers. I don’t have any pets, but I do enjoy spending time with my brother’s dog and if I had one, it would probably be a golden retriever. In my free time, I like to play video games, watch movies/TV, and listen to music. One of the places I enjoy going to is Lake Champion, which hosts the camp that I go to called Camp Veritas, which is a Christian camp for ages 12-18. Thanks to Camp Veritas, I managed to meet many new people and make friends. I also have a bucket list, which contains some of the places that I want to visit such as London or Paris.</p>

            <h2>CSS Animation Blog</h2>

            <div>

                <p>The world has changed over the years and there are big differences between the world today and the world from decades past. One example is cars. Back then, nobody had a self-driving car such as Tesla. People would drive the cars themselves, even if they were tired, because it was the only thing they could do on the road since they didn’t want to crash their car. Another instance is digital technology. In the past, for example, computers and phones weren’t as complex as they are now. There weren’t that many websites back then and phones weren’t digital back then, let alone use the Internet or an app such as Calculator or Clock. Artificial intelligence which is such a hot topic today wasn’t even widely available just a few years ago. A lesser known change which has redefined our user web experience is CSS animation. It was introduced in 2009, creating a connection between us, the users, and the website.</p>
                <p>So, what is CSS animation? CSS animation is a feature, used to display certain effects to a part of a webpage and feedback to an action that the user does on a webpage. One would say that the animation gives life to the webpage. CSS animation is a part of CSS, which is called Cascading Style Sheets, a language used to style coding languages such as HTML. One part of CSS animation works with JavaScript to enhance the user experience with simple animations such as button changing colors when hovered over or a logo that can move. For example, the hover feature allows users to put their cursor over a button, allowing the button to change in animation. This interaction is done, due to the :hover pseudo-class. Another example is a text animation, where the text does an animation when the user visits a website.</p>
                <p>Another part of CSS animation is SVG animation, which uses the @keyframes property and rule. The @keyframes rule points out the different stages of the animation. With this rule, developers can choose how an element can look and whether it’s at the start, the middle, or the end of the animation. There are other versions of this rule that are used by browsers. Two examples are @-moz-keyframes, which is used by Mozilla Firefox, and @-webkit-keyframes, which is used by Google Chrome. These versions are also used in the code to make sure that the animation works in every browser. It probably is exhausting for the developers because there will be multiple lines of this rule. The @keyframes property is used alongside the animation property. The animation property has sub-properties such as animation-name, which gives us the name of the @keyframes rule in the animation, animation-duration, which tells us how long the animation will last, animation-delay, which tells us how long before the start of the animation, and animation-direction, which tells us whether the animation goes forward or backward.</p>
                <p>CSS animation can be seen on the web and is used by browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome and search engines such as Google. For example, Google uses CSS animation in their logos when celebrating an event or holiday. Sometimes the logo can also be user-interactive when CSS animation is used. In addition to browsers and search engines, mobile phones such as IOS and Android and applications like iTunes also use CSS animation.</p>
                <p>CSS animation has enriched and enhanced modern day websites, where users find websites more interesting and engaging, compared to static HTML pages from the past.</p>
                <p>Here are some examples:</p>
