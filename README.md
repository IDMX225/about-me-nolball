 The name of this project is About Me. 
 
 
 Description

 This project will tell viewers something about myself. There are different sections, such as a Bio section, a  Hobbies section, a Literature section, and a Contact section. The coding language that was used is HTML. While creating this project, I learned new tags such as figcaption, figure, section, hr, select, fieldset, legend, form, article, header, and nav. I also used some tags I already knew from my previous knowledge such as p, div, head, and body. I also learned how to add a contact form, a video, and a caption for an image and how to add a navbar, which helps viewers go to different pages.
 
 Color Scheme
 
 The color scheme I used is very interesting. At first, it started off with colors such as an amber orange color (code: #de9a26, RGB: 222, 154, 38), 38, 127, a medium-dark blue (code:#267fde, RGB: 38, 127, 222), and a dark grayish-brown (code: #5e533f, RGB: 94, 83, 63).

 But, when I added colors such as red and seagreen, it made the page look better.
